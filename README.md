<h1 align="left">Simple Payment Program</h1>

###

<p align="left">This is a simple payment program based on a console UI and developed using Java.</p>

###

<p align="left">The program has mainly 3 options to choose from:</p>

###

<h2 align="left">1- Add Products Option</h2>

###

<p align="left">This option allows you to add many available products to the shopping cart. Available products are loaded from the database which are stored in the 'products' table.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">2- Process Payment Option</h2>

###

<p align="left">This option will process the payment of the shopping cart, and it will withdraw the amount of money from your card. However, for simplicity, I made this part to be simulated, as it assumes you have the amount of products, and it withdraws the amount from your card successfully. Another assumption is that the system assumes that you have a Visa card, however, you can change that from the PaymentProcessorOptionProcessor.java file.</p>

###

<p align="left">This option, by the way, needs some time to develop and enhance, in which a User Management System class is needed to handle the user information including the payment card strategy, whether it is a Visa, MasterCard, Paypal... etc.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">3- Exit Option</h2>

###

<p align="left">This option is simply for exiting the program. No further actions are needed here so far.</p>

###

<p align="left">This application has been made for the purpose of practicing the Java OOP concepts and the SOLID principles and needs a lot of development to make it more effective and efficient.</p>
